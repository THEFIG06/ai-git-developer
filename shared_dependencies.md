Based on the user's prompt, the shared dependencies between the files we are generating could be:

1. "README.md": This file will contain instructions on how to run the repo. It may reference the names of the other files, such as "main.py", "requirements.txt", and "setup.py".

2. "main.py": This is the main Python script that runs the application. It may import modules specified in "requirements.txt" and use setup configurations from "setup.py". It may also reference any global variables or functions defined within itself.

3. "requirements.txt": This file lists the Python packages that the application depends on. These package names will be shared with "main.py" and possibly "setup.py", as they may need to import these packages.

4. "setup.py": This file is used for package distribution and may reference the same Python packages listed in "requirements.txt". It may also reference "main.py" if it needs to specify the main script to run the application.

5. ".gitignore": This file specifies files and directories that Git should ignore. It may reference the names of all the other files if they need to be excluded from version control.

Please note that without specific details about the application, it's not possible to provide exact names of exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, or function names. However, these would typically be shared between "main.py", "setup.py", and possibly "README.md" if they are documented there.

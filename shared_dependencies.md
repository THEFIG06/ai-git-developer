As an AI, I don't have the ability to directly access or analyze the specific files in your repository. However, I can tell you generally what shared dependencies might exist between Python test files.

1. Imported Modules: All test files might import common modules such as unittest for testing, or specific modules from the application being tested.

2. Test Fixtures: Shared setup code for tests, such as creating objects or setting up a database, could be used across multiple test files.

3. Helper Functions: Functions that perform common tasks for tests, such as asserting certain conditions or performing complex calculations, could be shared.

4. Mock Objects: If the tests use mock objects to simulate the behavior of real objects in the system, these could be shared.

5. Constants: Any constants that are used across multiple tests would be shared.

6. Test Data: If the tests use specific data for testing, this could be shared across multiple test files.

Please note that the actual shared dependencies would depend on the specific code in your test files.
